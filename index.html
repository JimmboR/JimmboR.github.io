<div class="par"><p style="font-family:helvetica">To understand what a hypothetical megastructure is you first need to know what a megastructure is. A megastructure is, well, exactly what it sounds like. It is a very large building. For example, the worlds tallest building, the Burj Khalifa would be considered a megastructure. However the difenition of megastructure is very loose. Some people may say something is a megastructure, while someone else will say it isn't. Either way megastructures are a rare appearance in the real world.<p></div>
<div class="par"><p style="font-family:helvetica">This is where hypothetical or sometimes called theoretical megastructures come in. They often appear in space in pop culture books, films, and even video games. theoretical megastructures are fictional appearing in sci-fi however still based off of factual evidence and science. Most people probably know several instances of these without even realizing it. Some examples of this are, ringworlds, appearing in the popular fps game, Halo, the award wining Christofer Nolan movie, Interstellar, and the Disney Plus show, Boba Fett. One of the most well known megastructures is the Death Star, from the record breaking franchize, Star Wars.<p></div>
