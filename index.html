<div class="par"><p style="font-family:helvetica">To understand what a hypothetical megastructure is you first need to know what a megastructure is. A megastructure is, well, exactly what it sounds like. It is a very large building. For example, the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa would be considered a megastructure. However, the definition of a megastructure is very loose. Some people may say something is a megastructure, while someone else will say it isn't. Either way, megastructures are a rare appearance in the real world.</p></div>
<div class="par"><p style="font-family:helvetica">This is where hypothetical or sometimes called theoretical megastructures come in. They often appear in space in pop culture books, films, and even video games. Theoretical megastructures are fictional appearing in sci-fi however still based on factual evidence and science. Most people probably know several instances of these without even realizing it. Some examples of this are, ringworlds, appearing in the popular fps game, Halo, the award-winning Christofer Nolan movie, Interstellar, and the Disney Plus show, Boba Fett. One of the most well-known megastructures is, the Death Star, from the record-breaking franchise, Star Wars.</p></div>

<div class="parr"><p style="font-family:helvetica">A dyson sphere is a enormous solar panel that encompases a star providing an extremely large amount of energy.</p></div>
<div class="parr"><p style="font-family:helvetica">A dyson swarm is the same as a dyson sphere but it is made up of many smaller solar panels as pictured in the first image.</p></div>
<div class="parr"><p style="font-family:helvetica">A ringworld is a large space large ring spinning at high speeds to create artificial gravity providing infrastructure is space.</p></div>
<div class="parr"><p style="font-family:helvetica">A stellar engine uses the power of a dyson sphere to create thrust, pushing the star, and the solar system with it.</p></div>

<div class="parr"><p style="font-family:helvetica">I, Alexander Russ, am proposing a hypothetical megastructure of my own. I call it the Hawking Generator. It is similar to a dyson shpere but istead of harnessing the sloar energy of a star it would harness the hawking radiation of a black hole, hense the name.</p></div>
